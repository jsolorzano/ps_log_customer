# log_customer

_Module that allows registering specific events related to orders placed by customers._

## Starting

_These instructions will allow you to get a working copy of the module on your project._


### Pre requirements üìã

_Before starting, you need to know that this module is developed to work with prestashop in its versions 1.7.x._


### Installation üîß

_This module is included in a ps_log_customer github repository, so you need to clone it and then copy it to the modules folder of your prestashop project:_

1. Clone the repository containing the module:

```
https://github.com/jsolorzano/ps_log_customer.git
```

2. Copy the 'log_customer' folder contained within the repository to the modules folder of your prestashop project.

3. Go to the module catalog section in the administration panel of your prestashop project and install the new available module "Customer log module" or "M√≥dulo de logs de clientes" if your environment is in Spanish.



## Execution üöÄ

_Once all the previous steps have been carried out, you will be ready to use the functions provided by the module._

_The module's functions are attached to the internal workings of your prestashop project, so it does not require other configurations after installation. However, when you install the module, a series of Spanish translations are installed for it that you can customize at any time in the translations area of the International panel. You only need to select the module and the language to modify (Spanish) and you will have the module's translatable labels in a form._
