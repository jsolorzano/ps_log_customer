_Before starting, you need to know that this module is developed to work with prestashop in its versions 1.7.x._


### Installation üîß

_This module is included in the slider_modal package of the homonymous repository, so you need to clone it and then copy it to the modules folder of your prestashop project:_

1. Clone the repository containing the module:

```
https://github.com/jsolorzano/slider_modal.git
```

2. Copy the 'cms_pages' folder to the modules directory of your prestashop project.

3. Go to the administration panel of your prestashop project and install the new module 'cms_pages'.



## Execution üöÄ

_Once all the previous steps have been carried out, you will be ready to use the functions provided by the module._

_This module will also allow you to configure a list of urls that will be used as a filter by the js validator, with which you can determine which elements of the slider should open in a modal window and which should not._
